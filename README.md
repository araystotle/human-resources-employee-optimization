# Supervised Learning: Company Employees Classification
Given a dataset of employees working in a company (containing data such as education, years at the company, and job role, among others), a need may arise to predict whether a given employee is likely remain at the company or leave. Knowing this information may prompt the company to intervene and prevent the employee from leaving through actions such as a pay rise or promotion. This ends up saving the company revenue as capital would have been spent on hiring and training a new employee.

This project creates four different classifiers that try to predict whether an employee will leave the company or not. The models are then statistically analysed to find out which performs classification the best.
